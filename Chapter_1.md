### What is Pattern Recongnition？
Pattern Recognition is considered with the automatic discovery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of
these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.

### What is Classification and Regression?
Cases such as the digit recognition example, in which the aim is to assign each input vector to one of a finite number of discrete categories, are called classification
problems. If the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called regression.

### What is generalization？
The ability to categorize correctly new examples that differ from those used for training is known as generalization.
